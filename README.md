# vyisbot

Basically vyishere's bot.

> This bot is still in development process, if something isn't working or weird stuff happens, try to download an older version or maybe fix the code yourself, then send me a feedback, I would really appreciate it.

> About the volume command, it is not recommended to turn it all the way up to 300.
